## Feature Requests

I am planning to maintain Juken and add in more features down the line. Needless to say, I'm open to feature requests. To see what's planned and get insights on the roadmap, you can check out the tickets under each [milestone](https://github.com/oguzgelal/juken/milestones), tickets related to new features will have an `enhancement` tag. You can also head over to [issues](https://github.com/oguzgelal/juken/issues) section and submit your own feature request. 


## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in Juken, reporting it would be much appreciated. You can head over to the [open issues](https://github.com/oguzgelal/juken/issues) section and submit the issue from there. I'll try to fix bugs as quick as possible. Reporting bugs is easy, I made a crash screen that shows the error details (as shown below), so you can just take a screenshot of it and include it in your ticket.
