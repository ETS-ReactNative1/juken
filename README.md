## What is WaniAnki ?

WaniAnki is a minimalistic review app for [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) optimized for speed. It eliminates the need for typing; you just just have to recall, reveal the answer and submit by swiping left or right.

The user experience was inspired by the popular flashcard app [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) in the sense that it allows you to reveal the answer instead of having to typing it out, and it features a Tinder-like swipe interface to quickly submit your answers. Just login with your WaniKani Personal Access Token and start swiping.

## Platforms

WaniAnki is a cross-platform application, natively awailable on mobile platforms and is also optimized for the web. It's built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and uses [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) for the web support. There are a few different ways of using WaniAnki, below you can find some details on these methods. Note that Web, PWA and Expo apps will receive updates / bug fixes more frequently and earlier than the native iOS and Android counterparts due to the review process of app stores.

### Web / Mobile Web

WaniAnki not only supports the web platform, it is optimized for the desktop experience. You can do your reviews using only your keyboard, space to reveal the answer and arrow keys to submit the answer instead of the swipe gestures (although gestures are still supported for for touch screen devices using the web app). WaniAnki also supports the mobile web. You can go to [wanianki.com](wanianki.com) on your mobile browser and have a decent review experience (however native apps offers a much superior experience and are recommended).
